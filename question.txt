Task Description


Create a REST API for an e-commerce system using Laravel/Node.js. The API should include the following features:


1. Product and Product Variant Create and Read operations
    - Endpoints to create, update, delete and retrieve products.
    - A product should have at least a name, description, price, and can have multiple variants.
    - A variant should have a name, SKU, additional cost (compared to base product cost), and stock count.
    - When creating a product, the API should handle creating/updating/deleting variants too.


2. Search functionality
    - An endpoint that allows searching products by product name, description, or variant name.


3. Test Driven Development
You need to follow test driven development so -

* Write tests for the model to ensure data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
* Write tests for each endpoint to ensure they function as expected.
* Write tests to ensure the search functionality works as expected.


Deliverables


- A Git repository containing all code.
- A Readme file containing documentation explaining how to run your project, how to interact with the API, your architectural decisions, any assumptions made, and any other necessary instructions.
- Postman collection or an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification file for the API endpoints.


Evaluation Criteria


- Code quality, consistency, and use of best practices.
- Correct and efficient implementation of the functionality.
- Understanding of complex relationships in database design (product-variant relationships).
- Quality of the documentation.
- Unit and integration testing for the key components.
